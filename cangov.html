  <div class="column"><h2>Stacey Abrams</h2>
    <img src="Stacey.jpg" width= 400px >
      <p>Stacey Abrams grew up in Gulfport, Mississippi with her five siblings and her Samaritan Inducing parents who instilled in her to always give. Stacey and her younger siblings attended DeKalb County Schools. Stacey received degrees from Spelman College, the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, and Yale Law School.  She founded the New Georgia Project, which submitted more than 200,000 registrations for voters of color between 2014 and 2016. As co-founder of NOW Account – a financial services firm that helps small businesses grow – Stacey has helped create and retain jobs in Georgia. And through her various business ventures, Stacey has helped employ even more Georgians, including hundreds of young people starting out. Among other issues, Abrams advocates for criminal justice reform, race and gender equality, economic opportunity for all Georgians, access to affordable high-quality child care and the decriminalization of poverty.</p>

    <div class="column"><h2>Casey Cagle</h2>
      <img src="Casey.jpg" width= 300px >
      <p>The son of a single mother, Cagle grew up poor in North Georgia. Since childhood, his mother instilled the values of hard work and honesty that define Casey Cagle’s career in public service. Cagle’s been working in state politics since he was 28, just a kid in political years. After 12 years as Gainesville’s state senator, he claimed the lieutenant governorship, a post he’s held for just as long. The Lt. Gov. has been planning his run for more than a decade. His fundraising and front-runner status has made him a target for the rest of the field. In 2007, Cagle created the College and Career Academy to provide students with the opportunity for job training in high-demand fields while still in high school. <p>Cagle is campaigning on platforms of tax and regulatory reform, anti-abortion policy, the reduction of government spending, job creation, infrastructure and education. He was also a supporter of religious freedom measures and is a Second Amendment advocate. But a recent tussle with Delta Air Lines put Cagle in national headlines—he threatened to steal any prayer of fuel tax cuts for the Atlanta-based airline after it ended a group discount for members of the National Rifle Association, which likely pleased some Second Amendment bona fides but could have hurt his standing with the business community. </p>

    <div class="column"><h2>Brian Kemp</h2>
      <img src="Brian.jpg" width= 400px >
      <p> Kemp earned his bachelor of science degree in agriculture from the University of Georgia. Kemp owns Kemp Properties, a property management and contracting company. He served in the Georgia Senate from 2003 to 2007.
Republican Brian Kemp served as the Georgia secretary of state from 2010 until recently, when he resigned to run for governor. His campaign emphasizes support for agri-business, cutting regulations, the recruitment of big business and manufacturing into the state, investment in technology in rural areas and the elimination of tax incentives.
He’s also campaigning on a “Georgia First” platform that would work to defund sanctuary cities.</p>

<p>“From tackling illegal immigration and fundamentally reforming state government to making Georgia No. 1 for small business, I will put hardworking Georgians–not the special interests–first,” he says in an email.
As secretary of state, he’s found himself butting heads with gubernatorial competitor Stacey Abrams over allegations of voter suppression, and his office came under fire in 2015 when it accidentally leaked millions of voters’ registration information.
The Secretary of State has put law and order at the center of his campaign. He wants to pass the most restrictive abortion rules in the nation and put the clamps on illegal immigration. “I’m all for accountability courts and helping those who need helping,” he said. “But for those who are here illegally, and not following the rules, we need to send them home.” His rivals point to blunders as the state’s top elections official, including his office accidentally disclosing the Social Security numbers and other private information of more than 6 million voters to media outlets and political parties.</p>
