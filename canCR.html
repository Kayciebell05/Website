<p>
  Christopher M. Carr was sworn into office as Georgia's 54th Attorney General on November 1, 2016.
   Carr believes there is no more solemn responsibility than to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and the interests of the people of the State of Georgia.
  Governor Nathan Deal appointed Carr as Attorney General to fill a vacancy created by the departure of former Attorney General Sam Olens to become president of Kennesaw State University.
  Carr's term runs through 2018, when he will be eligible to seek election to a full four-year term.
  Carr serves on Georgia's Judicial Nominating Commission, the body charged with reviewing and recommending judicial appointments.
  He was appointed to the Commission in 2011 by Governor Deal
